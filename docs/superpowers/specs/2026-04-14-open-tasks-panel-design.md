# Open Tasks Panel — Design

**Date:** 2026-04-14
**Status:** Design approved; ready for implementation plan

---

## 1. Problem

Renewal issues are the natural "command center" for a renewal in progress, but today the user cannot triage outstanding work from the issue page:

- The Scope Rollup card (shipped in PR #208) surfaces open follow-ups on the issue's linked policies, but read-only.
- Child follow-ups attached to the issue's activity thread are editable individually, but there's no unified surface for "everything outstanding on this renewal."
- Stray follow-ups on scope policies (not yet attached to the issue) can't be attached or triaged from the issue page.
- The same aggregation problem exists on client, program, and policy pages — there's no single "what's outstanding?" view on any of them.

The user wants a unified, interactive **Open Tasks panel** that rolls up outstanding activity follow-ups across the relevant scope and supports inline triage actions, available on every page where aggregation makes sense: issue, client, program, policy.

## 2. Goals

- One command-center panel, rendered on issue / client / program / policy pages, showing every open follow-up in scope.
- Inline actions on each row: mark done, snooze, toggle My Move / Waiting, log & close, attach to issue, add note.
- `+ Add task` button to create a new follow-up attached to the current scope without leaving the page.
- Shared component (one template, one backend helper) parameterized by scope type.
- Small shared toast library so every action gives explicit confirmation feedback.
- **Touch-once compliance.** Per `CLAUDE.md` Golden Rule: one action in one place propagates to every surface that displays the same fact. No stale scalar denormalizations, no duplicate creation paths, no redundant displays that force the user to act twice. Enforced by §7.2 (scalar sync helpers), §7.3 (single creation helper), §7.4 (duplicate display removal), §7.5 (shared thread filter).

## 3. Non-goals (v1)

- **No Focus Queue changes.** Issues and their child follow-ups continue to appear independently. Score rollup deferred to v2.
- **No bulk select / bulk actions.** Per-row actions are faster for typical issue sizes (<10 items).
- **No reassign between policies.** A follow-up stays on its original policy.
- **No unattach-from-issue action.** Attach is one-way; misattaches are corrected via mark-done + re-log.
- **No SLA recompute on the issue itself.** The issue's own `due_date` and `follow_up_date` are unchanged by this panel. It's a display + action surface, not a driver of the issue's own timing.
- **No keyboard shortcuts** in v1. Consider `j/k/d/s` if usage justifies.
- **No notifications.** Toasts cover in-context confirmation; no badges, no pings.

## 4. Data

### 4.1 Backend helper

```python
def get_open_tasks(
    conn: sqlite3.Connection,
    scope_type: Literal["issue", "client", "program", "policy"],
    scope_id: int,
) -> dict:
    """Returns {
        "groups": [GroupDict, ...],   # ordered top-down per scope rules
        "total": int,
        "overdue": int,
        "waiting": int,
    }"""
```

Lives in `src/policydb/queries.py` alongside `_rollup_open_followups`. The existing `_rollup_open_followups` stays in place — it still drives the program Scope Rollup card on non-issue surfaces and is simpler than what we need for the interactive panel.

### 4.2 Group / row shapes

```python
GroupDict = {
    "key": str,            # stable id, e.g. "on_issue", "loose", "issue:42", "direct_client"
    "title": str,          # rendered header, e.g. "On this issue", "On ISS-2026-042"
    "subtitle": str | None,
    "rows": list[TaskRow],
}

TaskRow = {
    "activity_id": str,         # numeric string for activity rows, "P{pid}" for policy-source rows
    "subject": str,
    "activity_type": str | None,
    "follow_up_date": str,      # ISO YYYY-MM-DD
    "days_overdue": int,        # negative if future
    "disposition": str,
    "accountability": Literal["my_action", "waiting_external", "scheduled"],
    "policy_id": int | None,
    "policy_uid": str | None,
    "policy_type": str | None,
    "client_id": int,
    "client_name": str,
    "source": Literal["activity", "policy", "client"],
    "is_on_issue": bool,                  # does activity_log.issue_id == current scope (issue page only)
    "linked_to_other_issue": str | None,  # issue_uid if attached elsewhere
    "attach_target_issue_id": int | None, # resolved target for attach action (policy/client/program pages)
}
```

### 4.3 Grouping rules

| Scope | Groups (top-down) |
|---|---|
| `issue` | `on_issue` (items where `activity_log.issue_id = scope_id`) → `loose` (items on linked policies via `v_issue_policy_coverage` where `issue_id` is NULL or a different issue) |
| `client` | `direct_client` → one group **per open issue** (`issue_status NOT IN ('Resolved','Closed')`) touching this client, ordered by severity then earliest open follow-up → `loose_policies` (follow-ups on client's policies not covered by any open issue) |
| `program` | `on_program_issue` (items linked to any of the program's open issues) → `loose` (items on child policies not linked to an open issue) |
| `policy` | Single flat group `on_policy` — every open follow-up on this policy regardless of issue linkage |

**`direct_client` group** includes:
- `clients.follow_up_date` itself (as a synthetic row `C{client_id}` with `source="client"`)
- Any `activity_log` row with `client_id = scope_id`, `policy_id IS NULL`, `follow_up_done = 0`, `follow_up_date IS NOT NULL`

**"Open issue"** means an `activity_log` row with `item_kind='issue'` and `issue_status NOT IN ('Resolved', 'Closed', 'Merged')` and `merged_into_id IS NULL`. Used consistently across client/program grouping.

Within every group: sort by `days_overdue` desc, then `follow_up_date` asc.

### 4.4 Dedup / suppression rules

- Policy-source rows (`policies.follow_up_date` with no activity) are suppressed when an activity-source follow-up exists on the same policy — same rule as `get_all_followups()` and `_rollup_open_followups`.
- Client-source rows (`clients.follow_up_date`) always appear on the client page in `direct_client`. They are NOT suppressed by policy/activity rows.
- Archived policies (`archived = 1`) are excluded from every scope.
- Merged issues (`merged_into_id IS NOT NULL`): activities linked to a merged source issue are shown under the target issue's group. On the client page, the source issue's group is hidden (it's Closed).

## 5. Routes

All routes live in a new module `src/policydb/web/routes/open_tasks.py`. Registered in `app.py`.

### 5.1 Render

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/open-tasks/panel?scope_type=X&scope_id=N` | Renders the full panel partial. Used for initial lazy-load from each page, and as the target of every action's HTMX swap. |

### 5.2 Row actions

Each endpoint takes `return_scope_type` and `return_scope_id` in the body (hidden inputs). After mutating, it calls `get_open_tasks(return_scope_type, return_scope_id)` and renders `_open_tasks_panel.html`.

| Method | Path | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/open-tasks/{activity_id}/done` | `return_scope_type`, `return_scope_id` |
| `POST` | `/open-tasks/{activity_id}/snooze` | `days` (int) or `date` (ISO), `return_scope_*` |
| `POST` | `/open-tasks/{activity_id}/disposition` | `move=my\|waiting`, `return_scope_*` |
| `POST` | `/open-tasks/{activity_id}/log-close` | `return_scope_*` |
| `POST` | `/open-tasks/{activity_id}/attach` | `target_issue_id`, `return_scope_*` |
| `POST` | `/open-tasks/{activity_id}/note` | `text`, `return_scope_*` |

`activity_id` is a path segment with two forms:
- `"123"` — `activity_log.id` for activity-source rows
- `"P456"` — synthetic prefix for policy-source rows (operates on `policies.id = 456`'s `follow_up_date`)
- `"C789"` — synthetic prefix for client-source rows (operates on `clients.id = 789`'s `follow_up_date`)

Policy-source and client-source rows support only `done` and `snooze`. Other actions return 400.

### 5.3 Creation

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/open-tasks/new?scope_type=X&scope_id=N` | Returns an inline quick-log form partial. Fields: subject, policy dropdown (scoped — see below), follow-up date, disposition toggle. |
| `POST` | `/open-tasks/new` | Body: `subject`, `policy_id` (optional), `follow_up_date`, `disposition`, `scope_type`, `scope_id`. Creates `activity_log` row with appropriate `issue_id` + `policy_id`, runs `supersede_followups()`, returns re-rendered panel. |

Policy dropdown content per scope:
- `issue` → policies linked to the issue via `v_issue_policy_coverage`
- `client` → all non-archived policies on the client
- `program` → all child policies of the program
- `policy` → current policy only (dropdown hidden, hidden input)

If scope is `issue` and policy is blank → activity is attached at client level with `issue_id = scope_id`.
If scope is `client` and policy is blank → direct client follow-up, `issue_id = NULL`.

### 5.4 Route ordering rule

`/open-tasks/new` must be declared before `/open-tasks/{activity_id}/...` so `new` isn't captured as an id. This is the project's standing `feedback_route_ordering_literals_first` rule.

## 6. UI

### 6.1 Template files

- `src/policydb/web/templates/_open_tasks_panel.html` — the shared panel (top-level, not scoped to a page subfolder)
- `src/policydb/web/templates/_open_tasks_new_form.html` — the inline quick-log form
- `src/policydb/web/templates/_toast.html` — shared toast container + JS helper (new global infrastructure)

### 6.2 Panel layout

```

```

### 6.3 Row anatomy

- **Line 1:** Policy UID pill (font-mono, click opens policy page in new tab) + subject (truncated)
- **Line 2 (meta):** `{policy_type} · {client_name} · {activity_type}` small gray
- **Right side:** due date + red "Nd overdue" chip if `days_overdue > 0`
- **Action buttons:** appear on row hover (desktop) / always visible (touch):
  - `✓` Mark done
  - `💤 ▾` Snooze — dropdown with +1d / +3d / +7d / +14d / "Pick date"
  - `⏳` / `🏃` Waiting / My Move toggle
  - `⊗` Log & close (hidden on policy-source rows)
  - `🔗` Attach to issue (hidden on `on_issue` rows and policy-source rows)
  - `💬` Inline note

### 6.4 Empty states

- **Nothing in any group:** Panel collapses to one-line card "✓ Nothing outstanding" + `[+ Add task]`.
- **One group empty:** That group's header is hidden; the other fills the panel.
- **Scope has no applicable policies** (e.g., an issue with no linked policies): panel does not render at all. Existing activity thread handles the display.

### 6.5 Cross-linked rows

If a scope policy has an open follow-up attached to a *different* issue (not in the current scope), the row renders in the `loose` group with:

- Gray background / reduced opacity
- `🔗` button replaced by a small `ISS-XXX` link pointing at the other issue
- Tooltip: "Attached to ISS-XXX — open that issue to triage"

This prevents silent theft of another issue's thread. Works on all four pages.

### 6.6 Quick-log form (+ Add task)

Inline form rendered in place of the `+ Add task` button when clicked. Fields:

- Subject (required, text)
- Policy (combobox, scoped per §5.3)
- Follow-up date (date input)
- Disposition toggle (My move / Waiting)
- Save / Cancel buttons

HTMX POSTs to `/open-tasks/new` and re-renders the full panel on success.

### 6.7 Toasts

Shared `_toast.html` rendered once in `base.html`. JS helper `showToast(message, kind='success')` creates a transient pill at the bottom-right of the viewport, fades after 2.5s. Action handlers include an `hx-swap-oob` `<div id="toast-trigger" data-message="Snoozed +7d" data-kind="success"></div>` in the response; a tiny HTMX `afterSwap` listener reads it and calls `showToast`.

Kinds: `success` (green), `info` (blue), `warning` (amber), `error` (red). All actions use `success` on the happy path; errors show `error`.

## 7. Handler behavior

| Action | Activity-source | Policy-source |
|---|---|---|
| Mark done | `follow_up_done=1`, `auto_close_reason='manual'`, `auto_closed_by='open_tasks_panel'` | Policy-source: `policies.follow_up_date = NULL`. Client-source: `clients.follow_up_date = NULL` |
| Snooze | Shifts `activity_log.follow_up_date` by N days; no new row; supersession NOT rerun | Shifts `policies.follow_up_date` or `clients.follow_up_date` respectively |
| Waiting toggle | Sets `activity_log.disposition` to first config entry with `accountability='waiting_external'` (or empty for My Move) | N/A — button hidden |
| Log & close | `follow_up_done=1` AND `follow_up_date=NULL` | N/A — button hidden |
| Attach to issue | `activity_log.issue_id = target`. If already linked to a different issue, return confirmation popover ("This task is already on ISS-XXX. Move?") | N/A — button hidden |
| Note | Creates new `activity_log` row: `activity_type='Note'`, `subject={text}`, `follow_up_done=1`, `follow_up_date=NULL`, `policy_id` + `issue_id` inherited from parent row. Sibling note, not a parent edit. | Same — parent's `policy_id` used, `issue_id` NULL |
| + Add task | Creates `activity_log` row with `issue_id` + `policy_id` per §5.3, `item_kind='followup'`, runs `supersede_followups()` | N/A — new rows are always activity-source |

### 7.1 Attach-target resolution on non-issue pages

- **Policy page:** `attach_target_issue_id` = the row's policy's single open renewal issue. If none, button hidden. If multiple, attach button opens a small picker (list of open issues touching the policy).
- **Client page:** Same rule, keyed off the row's policy.
- **Program page:** `attach_target_issue_id` = the program's own renewal issue.

### 7.2 Scalar-date sync (touch once)

`policies.follow_up_date` and `clients.follow_up_date` are scalar denormalizations of the true state in `activity_log`. If the panel mutates an activity without re-syncing these, other surfaces (policy edit page inline date, sticky sidebar, Action Center bulk ops, renewal pipeline views) show stale dates — forcing the user to fix them in a second place. That violates touch-once.

Two new helper functions in `queries.py`:

```python
def sync_policy_follow_up_date(conn, policy_id: int) -> None:
    """Re-derive policies.follow_up_date from the earliest open activity
    follow-up on this policy. Sets NULL if no open activity rows exist.
    The activity_log is the source of truth; the scalar field is a cache."""

def sync_client_follow_up_date(conn, client_id: int) -> None:
    """Same for client-level activities (policy_id IS NULL)."""
```

**When each handler calls the sync helpers:**

| Action | Sync call |
|---|---|
| Mark done (activity-source) | `sync_policy_follow_up_date(policy_id)` if row had a policy, else `sync_client_follow_up_date(client_id)` |
| Snooze (activity-source) | Same — the activity's new date may or may not still match the scalar |
| Log & close | Same as mark done |
| Waiting toggle | No sync — disposition changes don't affect dates |
| Attach to issue | No sync — `issue_id` change, dates unchanged |
| Note | No sync — note is a new sibling activity, parent is untouched |
| + Add task | Existing `supersede_followups()` already syncs — no additional call |

**Policy-source and client-source rows:** These directly mutate `policies.follow_up_date` / `clients.follow_up_date`, so no sync helper is needed — they ARE the scalar.

### 7.3 Activity creation — single code path

`+ Add task` must not duplicate the existing quick-log logic on policy/client pages. Factor out a shared helper:

```python
def create_followup_activity(
    conn,
    *,
    client_id: int,
    policy_id: int | None,
    issue_id: int | None,
    subject: str,
    activity_type: str,
    follow_up_date: str | None,
    follow_up_done: bool,
    disposition: str,
) -> int:
    """Single creation path for any follow-up activity. Inserts into
    activity_log, calls supersede_followups() when a new open follow-up
    is created on a policy, runs auto_link_to_renewal_issue() if issue_id
    is not provided, and returns the new activity_log.id."""
```

All existing quick-log endpoints on policy edit, client activity tab, inbox process, and the new `+ Add task` endpoint call this helper. One place for creation → user edits once → propagates to every surface.

Existing quick-log endpoints are **refactored** to call this helper as part of v1, not left as parallel paths. This is scope creep, but it's the touch-once rule: if two code paths exist, behavior diverges and the user ends up "fixing" the same data in two places.

### 7.4 Duplicate display removal

Beyond the Scope Rollup "Open Follow-ups" subsection removal already in §8.2, the following redundant displays are reconciled as part of v1:

- **Client sticky sidebar follow-up list** (`clients/_sticky_sidebar.html`) — if it currently lists open follow-ups, those entries are removed and replaced with a single link/count: "3 open tasks →" that scrolls to the panel. Rationale: the panel is the canonical interaction surface on the client page; a duplicate list invites the user to click done in two places.
- **Policy edit page `follow_up_date` inline field** — kept, because a direct edit of this field (without an activity) is a valid "I'm just reminding myself" action. But the field is labeled "Next follow-up (auto-synced)" to signal that the panel's `+ Add task` is the richer path. When a panel action clears the date via sync helper, the field clears on next render.
- **Program page follow-up listing** — same treatment as client sidebar: collapsed to a link into the panel.

This reconciliation is scoped narrowly — audit these three surfaces only, fix duplicates where found, don't restructure the pages.

### 7.5 Thread history filter — one helper

Every activity thread (issue detail, client activity tab, program activity tab, policy activity section) must filter out rows owned by the panel. One shared helper:

```python
def filter_thread_for_history(rows: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Removes rows where item_kind='followup' AND follow_up_done=0
    AND follow_up_date IS NOT NULL — these belong to the Open Tasks
    panel, not the history view. Keeps notes, closed activities, and
    non-followup items."""
```

All four thread templates call this through their route handler. One rule, one place. When the rule changes, it changes everywhere.

### 7.6 Issue-scoped merge handling

- If current issue is merged into another (has `merged_into_id`), panel redirects to the target issue's panel with a banner "Merged into ISS-YYY."
- Closed / Resolved issues: panel renders but all action buttons disabled; banner "Issue resolved — reopen to triage tasks."

## 8. Integration points

### 8.1 Existing automation

All existing automation in `policydb-activities` continues to apply unchanged:

- `supersede_followups()` fires on `+ Add task`. Other actions (snooze, attach, note) do not fire it.
- `auto_link_to_renewal_issue()` does not fire for panel actions — we always set `issue_id` explicitly.
- `auto_close_followups(reason='issue_resolved' | 'issue_merged' | 'renewal_bound')` closes panel rows exactly as today when the parent issue hits those states.
- `auto_close_stale_followups()` applies unchanged; stale closures land in the activity history.
- Focus Queue / Action Center: no changes. Panel rows still appear in Focus Queue as FOLLOW-UP items.

### 8.2 Scope Rollup card

- The existing `_scope_rollup.html` "Open Follow-ups" sub-section is removed.
- Scope Rollup card continues to show: RFI, Checklist, Waiting On, Renewal Status, Financials, Contacts, Working Notes, Nested Issues.
- The removed sub-section is superseded by the new panel above it — same data, richer interaction.

### 8.3 Activity thread views

- Each page's existing activity thread (`_tab_activity.html` on clients, `_tab_activity.html` on programs, activity thread on issue detail, activity section on policy edit) becomes a **history** view.
- History view filters out any rows meeting the panel's "open task" criteria (`follow_up_done=0 AND follow_up_date IS NOT NULL`). Closed / Note / notes-only rows stay.
- The panel is the single source of truth for open tasks; the thread is the single source of truth for historical activity.

## 9. Pages receiving the panel

| Page | Template insertion point | Lazy or inline |
|---|---|---|
| Issue detail (`issues/detail.html`) | Above Scope Rollup card | Inline on page load |
| Client detail (`clients/edit.html`, Overview tab) | Top of Overview tab, above Account Summary | Lazy-loaded when Overview tab opens |
| Program detail (`programs/_tab_overview.html`) | Above Scope Rollup | Lazy-loaded |
| Policy edit (`policies/edit.html`) | Above activity thread | Inline |

Lazy-loading uses `hx-trigger="load"` on an empty container with `hx-get="/open-tasks/panel?scope_type=X&scope_id=N"`.

## 10. Edge cases

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| Issue has no linked policies | Panel does not render. Existing activity thread covers it. |
| Issue is merged | Panel redirects to target with banner. |
| Issue is Closed/Resolved | Panel renders read-only with banner. |
| Policy archived | Row excluded from every panel. |
| Policy has multiple open issues touching it | Attach button opens small picker. |
| Row's activity already attached to another issue | Grayed out, attach replaced with link to other issue. |
| Note text empty | Save button disabled; no-op. |
| Snooze to a past date | Allowed — same as manual re-diary today. |
| + Add task with no policy, on policy page | Not possible — dropdown hidden, always equal to current policy. |
| + Add task creates dup follow-up on same policy | Supersession handles it — new row wins, old row auto-closes with `superseded` reason. |
| Two users simultaneously (rare, local app) | Last write wins. Next action re-reads the panel. |

## 11. Config

No new config keys. Reuses:

- `follow_up_dispositions` — to resolve "Waiting on Response" label for the toggle
- `focus_score_weights` — unchanged (no Focus Queue integration)
- `stale_auto_close_days` — unchanged
- `renewal_issue_auto_create`, `renewal_issue_auto_link` — unchanged

## 12. Testing

- Unit tests for `get_open_tasks()` covering each `scope_type` with fixtures containing mixed activity-source / policy-source / cross-linked / archived / merged data.
- Route tests for each handler with both `activity_id` forms (`"123"` and `"P456"`).
- Template test: panel renders with empty groups, partial-empty groups, fully-empty state, and cross-linked grayed rows.
- Manual browser QA on all four pages per CLAUDE.md "QA Testing Requirement."
